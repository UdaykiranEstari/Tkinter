## Features

- Real-time data: The GUI fetches the latest COVID-19 data using an API from reliable sources and displays it in a visually appealing manner.
- Interactive Graphs and Plots: All visualizations are interactive, allowing users to zoom in, pan, and hover over data points for detailed information. The graphs and plots are created using Plotly, providing a rich set of functionalities.
- Date selection: Users can select specific dates using a pop-up calendar widget, enabling them to analyze COVID-19 cases for a particular time period.
- Comparison of places: The GUI allows users to compare COVID-19 cases between different places or areas. Users can select the places of interest from a dropdown menu, providing a convenient way to focus on specific locations.
